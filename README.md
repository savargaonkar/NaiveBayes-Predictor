# NaiveBayes-Predictor
This specific project was with a insurance service provider, it was to predict on-going subscription for customers using their demographic data. I used the Naive Bayes model to classify and predict their subscription status with an accuracy of 92%. I have made a limited version of the data used for analysis available and the code can be further enhanced with additional demographic data as well as scaled up for use.
